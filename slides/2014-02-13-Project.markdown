  + Data (URL or sampled)
  + *May 16* midnight

---

## Groups

  + 1-2 people

---

## Proposal

  + Informal, not graded
  + A plan for your project
  + After the proposal you should just be executing, not brainstorming
  + Discussions before proposal encouraged

---

## Report

  + Introduction: problem, insights, solutions
  + Problem: motivation, data set
  + Solution: techniques, failures, examples
  + Details: parameter tuning, software engineering challenges
  + Related work: including resources you used
  + Further work: any remaining ideas you have

???

## Notes

  + Length: around 2 pages, but more important to hit these points
  + Introduction: "gosh, if these insights are true, it would be really
    exciting"
  + Problem: include problems with your data set
  + Solution: if you do clustering, give examples of a cluster you found and
    individual data points that it contains
  + Details: what commands did you use for particular libraries. Can someone
    duplicate you work?
  + Formats: PDF, Google Doc

## Research Paper

  + [How to write a good research paper](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/giving-a-talk/writing-a-paper-slides.pdf)
  + But much shorter!

???

## Skip sections

  + No abstract
  + Think paragraphs instead of pages

---

## Presentation

  + ~10 minutes
  + Think: 1 slide per paragraph
  + Focus on images, stories, examples
  + Motivate people to read your paper, don't read it to them

---

## Code

  + Another GitHub repository
  + If private, add Shreyas and me
  + Include README with info on how to run algorithms
  + Suggestion: include your paper

???

## Reproducible

  + Imagine if someone wanted to reproduce your results
  + Also great for portfolio (with Paper)

---

## Data

  + If large, just point to URL in paper and README
  + If very large, talk with me about hosting on Amazon Web Services
  + We'll have computing resources available from Amazon
